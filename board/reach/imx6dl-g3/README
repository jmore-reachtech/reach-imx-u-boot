1. Booting from the SD card
---------------------------

1a) Building U-Boot for SD card boot

$ make mrproper
$ make imx6dl_g3_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the u-boot.imx binary.

1b) Booting from the SD card

- Flash the u-boot.imx binary into the SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

- Insert the SD card into the J12 slot.

- Let pins 2-3 of jumper JP1 in the open position

- Power up the board and U-boot messages should come up in the console
